The Hospital Management System is a robust solution for managing patients, doctors, and appointments in a healthcare setting. This system allows users to add patient details, view doctor information, and schedule appointments. It also provides the ability to update appointment statuses and track patient appointments efficiently. With the integration of email notifications, patients receive appointment confirmations directly in their inbox. Built using Hibernate for ORM and Java, the system ensures smooth database interactions while providing a user-friendly interface for healthcare management. This tool aims to enhance hospital operations and patient experience by simplifying administrative tasks.
